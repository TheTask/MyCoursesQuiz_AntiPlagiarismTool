# MyCoursesQuiz_AntiPlagiarismTool

An antiplagiarism tool developed by Marek Borik during the Winter 2021 semester and the COVID-19 pandemic to spot highly unusal similarities of answers between students from the output of the MyCourses Exam tool. It takes the raw csv file generated by MyCourses as an argument. Optionally you can specify the student IDs in the code to target specific subset of the students from the csv file, or leave the list empty to consider all students. The output file format was strictly specified by the at-the-time supervisor professor Joseph D'Silva.

A sample of the input csv file is not provided for students' privacy protection.

Here is a sample txt output file for 2 students:
